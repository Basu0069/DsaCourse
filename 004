call by value = values 

call by address/ pointer  = pointer valyr 

call by reference = referecne variable 



Q which of these function is better in terms of complexity 
a) void swap(int x , int y){
    int temp;
    temp = x;
    x=y;
     y=temp;

}
this space = 6 bytes 
here only 4 operations ae follwee here 




b) void swap(int x, int y){
    x= x+y;  // 2 operations here 
    y= x-y; // 2 operations here too 
    x= x-y;  // 2 operations here too 
}
this spcae = 4 bytes 
and here  6 operations are folow 

ANS- a 

give preference to time complexity over space okay
