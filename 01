Finite Automata 

-Representation of computation 
-Fiite Steps to solve a problem--- input ,output,testcases. 




*DFA -> Determistic finite automata-- that it follows certain things 
1) Steps are finite 
2)Every state has transation with every input symbol 
3)Single input-> Single output 



eg we will take of ATM Machine 

single input giving multiple oujtput 

Insert a Card -> money , message , transit 

ATM machine is a NFA (Non-deterministic finite automata)



DFA MEANS IF U PUT SINGLE INPUT -> SIngle output comes 
NFA MEANS IF U PUT SINGLE INPUT -> Multiple outputs come 

eg2) Vending Machine-> code - bottle 











*DFA

TUPLES
1)Q-> Set os states{qo, q1, q2 , ---}
2)Σ->Input symbol set {a,b,c ---}
3)δ->Transition function qo -> input 
4)qo -> intial state 
5)Final state(o/p is achiever);


Example 

i/p symbol-> a     (only a's);
Create DFA that consist of all set of strings problem  that containing atleast 2a's 

o/p= {aa, aaa,aaaa,-----}  it means my outptu are infinte okay 
these "aa" will be my test cases okay 





NOW another eg- 
i/p -> a 
o/p-? {aa,aaa,aaaa,-----}
atlast 2a's {DFA};

Trick how to solve --->
1)create Generized DFa 
2)State single transition with i/ps 
3) right answers(Test vases are accepted)
Wrong answers must be(rejected);




{aa,aaa,aaaa,aaaaa,------};

ans- generalized dfa as q0 

q0  a  q1 a  q2 
Every State has Single Transition with I/p 

encounted with q1 we get a and with q2 we get 2a okay 

Does q2 have trnasion with a? NO 


LOOP-> any no fo anything 

SO aqns will be {aa, }
if we get a with q2 we get 
if we gtet 2's from right side okay 

{aa,aaa,aaaa}








here see 
{aa,aaa,aaaa,aaaaa,----};

q0 -> a -> q1 ->a -> q2

q2 can take 0 a's or 1a's or 2a's or 3a's 
it is a looping process basically okay 





QUESTION2) Exactly 2 a's 

O/P ->{aa};

->q0   a    q1   a    q2    a  dead  a 


but here 12 doesnt have any transtion 

so here we would put a and then put a dead state here and put a on it 
it is non computable 
q2 also have a transtion with a but it is dead stae oaky 
we put the loop ond dead state okay 

we didint put a on q2 because it would result in aaa and we have to work on exactly 2 a's okay 

4 transtions are happening here 




QUESTion) ATmost 2a's 

{ blank, a,aa};

here we are having 3 answers 
q0  a  q1  a  q2   a dead   a 

here we get the blank final state in q0 and a in q1 alSO FINAL STATE  and aa in q2 also final state 
we hAVE     3 states here and all states are fibnal states okay 









Question: Even numbers of a's   {a}; this is finite cant use 2 a in one transtion 

0 a's ,aa,aaaa,aaaaaaaaa,


q0  a  q1   a q2  a q1  a q2 a q1    5 a's  this is answer too okay 

q0 a q1 a   this is answer too
